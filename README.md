Hi 👋🏼 I'm Joanne Lee, a UX designer based in Seoul, Korea.
This repository is for showcasing some of the projects I've worked on.
The entire website is hosted on [GitHub] (obviously!) and powered by [Jekyll].
You can have a look at the site structure [here] or check out the published pages at [joannelee.kr].
If you're interested in what I do or have any questions regarding this repo, feel free to drop me a line via email (<joanne.j.leee@gmail.com>) or Twitter ([@joanneleey]).
