<h2>User research</h2>
<p>Because of the Holter monitor test's specificity as a medical test and the complexity of the regulations and concerns involved, it was essential to acquire domain knowledge and conduct in-depth user research at the outset.</p>
<p class="subsection">The first phase of the research involved visiting hospitals to understand the environment of cardiology clinics and to learn about the typical initial consultation and testing process for patients with suspected cardiovascular disease. The findings and information gathered during this process allowed the following phase, user interviews, to be conducted more thoroughly.</p>
{% include project-image.html filename="field-research" alt="Field research at cardiology clinic" title="Field research at cardiology clinic" %}
<p class="subsection">Those directly or indirectly involved in the overall process from consultation to diagnosis were categorised into five groups: doctors, clinical pathologists, patients, nurses, and patient caregivers, and user interviews were designed and conducted accordingly. The categorisation was then elaborated based on the results (e.g. separating the pathologists in clinics and those in hospitals), and corresponding personas were defined for each. Finally, the workflows of these groups were diagrammed in the form of a journey map, allowing for detailed planning and design based on hypotheses about where the new product should engage with users and how it could address pain points in their existing day-to-day experiences.</p>

<p class="subsection">Due to the nature of the medical field, it is impossible to introduce a product that is radically different from the previous one. Hence a great deal of effort was put into researching products that are already in use in the industry. Conventional Holter ECG software interfaces were carefully analysed in order to familiarise users with the new system based on their past experiences. Moreover, to identify the standard configuration of an ECG report prior to information design, a variety of reports from other providers were examined, as well as consulting with healthcare professionals for a further understanding of arrhythmias.</p>

<h2>Medical diagnosis software</h2>
<p>MEMO's diagnosis software is a cloud-based web application that allows users to manage Holter monitor tests, and also to review and edit data without installing any additional programs.</p>
<p class="subsection">The dedicated website displays a list of tests when you sign in. The tests are largely divided into four groups: [In Process], [Pending Upload], [Under Review], and [Review Completed], aligned with the workflow of nurses and clinical pathologists. The [In Process] tab is where the new tests are added to the database, as well as processing device returns of the finished tests. Once a test is marked as returned, it is then moved to the [Pending Upload] tab, where you can see how many tests are due for data upload and transfer the files extracted from the device to the server. After uploading the data, the test will be in the [Under Review] tab and undergo AI analysis. When the AI has finished processing the recorded data, you can click on the item and access the results. Finally, once the medical staff has reviewed the test data and marked it as complete, it will be transferred to the [Review Completed] tab, where you can generate ECG reports.<br><br>Because the information and actions required for managing the tests differ depending on the work phase, each tab is configured slightly differently in terms of the details shown in the list and its sorting criteria.</p>
{% include works/memo-2022-test-lists.html %}
<p class="subsection">You can review the test data by clicking the item in the test list that the AI has completed analysing. The test data page consists of three tabs, beginning with the [Summary] tab. This tab contains metadata such as basic information about the patient and the test, simple computed values related to the heart rate, and representative ECG strips for each arrhythmia class detected, giving the user an idea of the overall cardiological condition of the patient.</p>
{% include project-image.html filename="result-detail-1" alt="Test data - Test summary" title="Test data - Summary" %}
<p class="subsection">The [Complete ECG] tab lets you view all ECG data recorded during the test. Intervals with arrhythmia are highlighted by a light blue background colour and a class label. If you want to check data from a specific point in time, you can enter the date and time to jump to that spot.</p>
{% include project-image.html filename="result-detail-2" alt="Test data - Complete ECG" title="Test data - Complete ECG" %}
<p class="subsection">The [Event List] tab is where you can view and edit the events that the algorithm has determined to be arrhythmic. The top of the screen displays a time series graph of the heart rate (HR) trend over the test period, while the bottom left shows a list of arrhythmia events and the right shows detailed information on the selected item. The HR graph also features the patient's bedtime information, and you can navigate to the specific timeframe by clicking on the graph. If there are any events where the patient recorded that they felt symptoms, they will be annotated on the HR graph and in the event list so that you can pinpoint them quickly.<br><br>When it comes to determining if and what kind of arrhythmia occurred, it can often be helpful to check the ECG data backwards and forwards, as well as the area of concern. Therefore the application allows you to swipe across to see up to 30 seconds of ECG data for each item, including 10 seconds before and after the event. Additionally, hotkeys have been mapped to the core buttons in order to accelerate the workflow when there are lots of items to review. All hotkeys can be operated with one hand, ensuring there is no inconvenience when used simultaneously with a mouse.</p>

<h2>ECG report</h2>
<p>An ECG report, a final product of the test, plays a crucial role in diagnostic and patient consultation. The productivity of medical staff depends on how efficiently vast amounts of test data can be summarised, making document structure and information design particularly critical.</p>
<p class="subsection">By clicking the [Generate Report] button on the [Review Completed] tab of the Test List page, you can select ECG strips to put on the report's cover page for each arrhythmia class. Since the medical staff typically includes the sections with the most apparent symptoms on the cover page, these are automatically recommended and placed as the first item.</p>
{% include project-image.html filename="report-strip-selector" alt="Selecting ECG strips to be included in the report" title="Selecting ECG strips to be included in the report" %}
<p class="subsection">The cover page presents basic information about the test and the segments selected when generating the report, giving a quick overview of the test results. The subsequent pages are organised by arrhythmia class, with high-risk ones, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and atrial fibrillation (AF), being displayed first, as their severity varies by type. In addition, where additional statistics are needed, they are accompanied by relevant data. For instance, when diagnosing atrial fibrillation, the percentage of time in a day that AF occurred (AF burden) is considered clinically significant; thus, it is visualised on the top of the page as a bar graph.</p>

<p class="subsection">As various types of information are included in the report, the lack of clarity on how the figures are calculated could be a problem for product development and its credibility. Therefore, apart from the information and editorial design, all the specifics related to the configuration of each section were clearly defined and set out in a detailed document. During this process, constant feedback from healthcare experts and the development team on whether the criteria are clinically meaningful or if the values can be derived through processing the collected data was sought, and the deliverables were revised and improved accordingly.</p>
